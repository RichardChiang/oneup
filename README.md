# Progressive Chess Understanding via Self-Evaluating Language Models

## Abstract

We present a novel approach to developing true chess understanding in language models through progressive difficulty training and self-evaluation. Our system combines unicode-based chess representation for optimal tokenization, curriculum learning with increasingly complex chess tasks, and a self-judging reinforcement learning framework. The model learns to evaluate its own chess reasoning across multiple dimensions (completeness, specificity, directional accuracy) and uses these self-generated scores as reward signals for GRPO/DPO training. This approach aims to develop genuine positional understanding rather than pattern memorization.

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Statement
Current language models struggle with true chess understanding, often relying on pattern matching rather than genuine positional comprehension. Traditional chess notation (FEN, algebraic) creates tokenization challenges that hinder model learning.

### Our Approach
- **Unicode Representation**: Each chess piece (♔♕♖♗♘♙) gets a single token, avoiding subword splitting
- **Progressive Curriculum**: Start with simple counting tasks, advance to complex positional analysis
- **Self-Evaluation**: Model judges its own responses on multiple criteria
- **RL Integration**: Self-evaluation scores drive reinforcement learning

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Chess Representation
```
Standard: "8/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"
Unicode: "♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜♟♟♟♟♟♟♟♟□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□♙♙♙♙♙♙♙♙♖♘♗♕♔♗♘♖"
```

**Benefits:**
- Each piece = 1 token (no subword splitting)
- Cleaner pattern recognition
- Consistent tokenization across positions

### 2.2 Progressive Curriculum Design

**Level 1: Basic Counting**
- Count total pieces on board
- Count pieces by type (pawns, rooks, etc.)
- Count pieces by color

**Level 2: Position Identification**
- Identify piece on specific square
- List all pieces of a given type
- Describe piece placement patterns

**Level 3: Basic Analysis**
- Identify attacked squares
- Find pinned pieces
- Recognize basic tactics

**Level 4: Strategic Understanding**
- Evaluate pawn structure
- Assess piece coordination
- Identify weaknesses/strengths

**Level 5: Complex Reasoning**
- Multi-move tactical sequences
- Strategic planning
- Position evaluation

### 2.3 Self-Evaluation Framework

The same language model acts as both student and teacher, evaluating its chess responses across multiple dimensions:

**Evaluation Criteria (0-10 scale each):**
- **Completeness**: Did the response address all aspects of the question?
- **Specificity**: Is the response detailed rather than generic?
- **Directional Accuracy**: Is the analysis heading in the right direction?
- **Chess Validity**: Are the chess concepts correctly applied?

**Structured Generation:**
```json
{
  "completeness_score": <int 0-10>,
  "specificity_score": <int 0-10>, 
  "directional_accuracy": <int 0-10>,
  "chess_validity": <int 0-10>,
  "reasoning": "<explanation>"
}
```

**Aggregation Function:**
```python
final_score = (
    0.3 * completeness + 
    0.25 * specificity + 
    0.25 * directional_accuracy + 
    0.2 * chess_validity
)
```

### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning Pipeline

**Training Loop:**
1. Generate response to chess question
2. LLM judge evaluates response (with correct answer as reference)
3. Multi-dimensional scores converted to reward signal
4. GRPO/DPO training updates model weights
5. Advance difficulty when success threshold reached

**Success Criteria:**
- Level advancement: 85% average score on current difficulty
- Final evaluation: Human expert validation on held-out test set

  - *Mitigation*: Testing on diverse chess scenarios

## 7. Human-in-the-Loop Bootstrap System

### 7.1 Interactive Chess Chat Interface

To accelerate training data collection and model bootstrapping, we implement a web-based chat interface using Lichess tactics data. This creates a supervised learning foundation before the full RL system is operational.

**Key Components:**
- **Lichess Tactics Integration**: Load 3M+ tactics puzzles from Lichess database
- **Chat Interface**: Web-based conversation system with chess position rendering
- **Human Feedback**: Thumbs up/down rating system for model responses
- **Training Data Serialization**: Convert conversations to SFT examples automatically
- **Real-time Model Interaction**: Deploy intermediate model checkpoints for testing

### 7.2 Business Rationale

- **Speed to Value**: Collect high-quality training data immediately while main system develops
- **Data Quality**: Human feedback ensures training examples are valuable
- **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage existing Lichess data rather than creating from scratch
- **Iterative Development**: Test model capabilities continuously with real users
- **Scalability**: Interface can handle multiple simultaneous conversations

### 7.3 Technical Architecture

**Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid prototyping, chess.js for board rendering  
**Backend**: FastAPI for model serving, PostgreSQL for conversation storage  
**Chess Data**: Lichess tactics CSV loaded into database with search indexing  
**Model Serving**: HuggingFace Transformers with VLLM for fast inference  
**Feedback Pipeline**: Real-time conversion of rated conversations to training format

```
User ↔ Streamlit UI ↔ FastAPI Backend ↔ Model (VLLM)
                            ↓
                    PostgreSQL Storage
                            ↓
                    Training Data Pipeline
```

### 7.4 Data Flow

1. **Tactics Loading**: Parse Lichess CSV, store in PostgreSQL with full-text search
2. **User Interaction**: Present random tactic, collect model explanation
3. **Human Rating**: User provides thumbs up/down with optional comments
4. **Data Serialization**: Store conversation as (input, output, rating, metadata)
5. **Training Integration**: Convert high-rated examples to SFT format
6. **Model Updates**: Retrain periodically on accumulated positive examples

### 7.5 Integration with Progressive Training System

The bootstrap chat interface and progressive RL system work synergistically:

**Data Flow Integration**:
1. Bootstrap collects high-quality SFT examples immediately
2. SFT-trained models provide better starting point for RL curriculum
3. Progressive system generates more sophisticated examples for chat interface
4. Chat feedback validates complex reasoning before expert evaluation

**Technical Integration Points**:
- **Shared Unicode Representation**: Both systems use same chess encoding
- **Model Checkpoints**: Chat interface tests each progressive training milestone
- **Evaluation Consistency**: Same scoring criteria used in both feedback systems
- **Data Augmentation**: Chat conversations inform progressive question generation

**Quality Bootstrapping Loop**:
```
Lichess Data → Chat Interface → Human Feedback → SFT Training → 
Better Model → Progressive Training → Advanced Model → Chat Interface → ...
```

## 8. Deployment Architecture

### Bootstrap System Infrastructure
```
Load Balancer (nginx) 
    ↓
Streamlit App (Docker containers)
    ↓
FastAPI Backend (VLLM + HF Transformers)
    ↓
PostgreSQL (tactics + conversations)
    ↓
Redis (session cache + task queue)
    ↓
Celery Workers (data processing)
```

### Production Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Streamlit apps behind load balancer
- **Model Serving**: VLLM for 10x faster inference than standard transformers
- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL with read replicas for chat history
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK for full observability
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances for non-critical workloads

### Security and Compliance
- **User Privacy**: No PII storage, anonymous conversation tracking
- **Model Safety**: Content filtering for inappropriate chess discussions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse while allowing genuine usage
- **Data Retention**: 90-day conversation retention for training purposes

## 9. Future Extensions

- **Multi-game generalization**: Extend to other board games
- **Advanced human feedback**: RLHF integration with preference modeling
- **Explainable chess AI**: Visualize learned concepts
- **Tournament integration**: Test in actual chess competitions

   # Create simple training script
   python scripts/train_sft.py --quality-threshold 0.7
   ```

2. **MLX Model Integration** (CHESS-009):
   - Replace HuggingFace with MLX in model serving

- **Impossible to Use Wrong**: Level progression validates prerequisites automatically
- **Observable Progress**: Clear metrics and advancement criteria
- **Self-Healing**: Training failures recoverable with simple re-runs

This approach transforms complex distributed ML engineering into elegant chess domain engineering, keeping the focus where it belongs: understanding chess, not managing infrastructure.
